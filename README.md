# RSA_cracking

This repository is based on cracking RSA encryption keys. It is limited by design in capability so that working encryptions are not cracked.

# Motivations
Built to aid personal understanding of RSA encryption.

# Build Status
## potential updates
- adapting for multicore
- adding for larger keys

# Current languages
- Python 3
- C++

# Projects
## python 3
The python script is imperfect. It was used as a testing ground for the C++ code as it is much quicker to develop in python, however, with bigger keys, the speed is unsuitable
## C++
The C++ code is much quicker at cracking keys.
